DLL: Swap Nodes in Pairs (âš¡Interview Question)
You are given a doubly linked list.

Implement a method called swap_pairs within the class that swaps the values of adjacent nodes in the linked list. The method should not take any input parameters.

Note: This DoublyLinkedList does not have a tail pointer which will make the implementation easier.

Example:

1-->2-->3-->4--> should become 2-->1-->4-->3-->

Your implementation should handle edge cases such as an empty linked list or a linked list with only one node.

Note: You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only the nodes' prev and next pointers may be changed.)
